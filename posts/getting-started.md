## Introduction

Hosting a website used to be complicated. You needed to buy a domain, find a hosting provider, and configure servers. But with **GitHub Pages**, you can host a static website for free, directly from your GitHub repository.

## Why GitHub Pages?

*   **Free:** No hosting fees.
*   **Integrated:** Works directly with your code.
*   **Fast:** Served via a CDN.

## How it Works

1.  Create a repository named `username.github.io`.
2.  Push your HTML, CSS, and JS files.
3.  That's it!

## Code Example

Here is a simple HTML snippet:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

## Conclusion

It's a great way to showcase your portfolio!
